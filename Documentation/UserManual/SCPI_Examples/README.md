# SCPI Programming Examples
This directory contains some basic examples, demonstrating the scripting capabilities of the LibreVNA using the SCPI interface. They are only intended as a starting point, for the complete list of available commands see the [SCPI Programming Guide](../ProgrammingGuide.pdf).

## How to run the examples
1. Connect the LibreVNA to your computer
2. Start the LibreVNA-GUI and make sure that the SCPI server is enabled (Window->Preferences->General). The examples use the default port (19542).
3. Use python3 to run an example
